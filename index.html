However, we think that the process of working with the PGT tool is quite tough for astronauts, given the fact that they have to be gripped to an object in order not to be rotated by the tool due to the lack of gravity, and the fact that it is very difficult to manage tiny objects such as screws with the bulky gloves that are a part of their spacesuit.

		<button class="txtTab" onClick="document.getElementById(&quot;mainTxt&quot;).innerHTML = &quot;NASA International Space Apps 2020<br><br>Participating in the NASA Space Apps Challenge was something we hadn’t initially planned ahead to be honest. We saw a few ads about it on our social media, so we decided to give it a go. The hackathon itself was quite interesting. Time truly flies when you’re having fun with your friends, regardless of all the dilemmas and obstacles you have to overcome in order to create a successful and meaningful end product. Our expectations weren’t that high at the beginning and we were satisfied with the experience of participating in this hackathon, despite of the outcome. Everything changed the moment when our local organizers announced the winning team, the team which would be nominated to continue to global round. Disbelief and pure joy were the only two things we felt at that moment. Never in a million years did we expect to get the opportunity of being able to compete on a global scale. Not a lot has changed since that day. We are still the same four enthusiastic high school students, eager to bring change to the world of Aeronautics and Aerospace engineering.<br><br>About us:<br>Andreja Popovikj (17)<br>Contact number: +389 71 260 483<br>Email: <a href='mailto:andrejpianist@gmail.com'>andrejpianist@gmail.com</a><br><br>Matej Milosievski (16)<br>Contact number: +389 71 444 231<br>Email: <a href='mailto:matej.m.ykc@gmail.com'>matej.m.ykc@gmail.com</a><br><br>Orhan Bagashov (17)<br>Contact number: +389 75 326 309<br>Email: <a href='mailto:orhanbagashov@gmail.com'>orhanbagashov@gmail.com</a><br><br>Teo Kitanovski (16)<br>Contact number: +389 75 661 021<br>Email: <a href='mailto:teokitan@outlook.com'>teokitan@outlook.com</a>&quot;">About us</button>
